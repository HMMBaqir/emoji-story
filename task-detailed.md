Overview
Build an "Emoji Story Generator" where users can create, share, and translate stories written entirely in emojis. The system will allow creating emoji stories and provide automatic "translations" into regular text.

Task Description
Create a platform where users can compose stories using only emojis. The system will attempt to generate a humorous narrative translation based on the emoji sequence. Users can save their favorite stories and view popular translations.
